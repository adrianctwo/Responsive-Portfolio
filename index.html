            <p>
                I graduated from University of California, Irvine with a Bachelor of Psychology. I have been working as
                a Human Resource generalist with experience managing global team and help multi-million-dollar company
                to grow. I have experience with full-cycle recruiting (phone screen, in-person interview, onboarding,
                and orientation), employee performance review, investigation, and labor laws. I consider myself a
                ‘forever student,’ because I’m always trying to learn about the latest labor laws and subjects that will
                improve me as a person.
                <br><br>
                I’m currently enrolled in the UW bootcamp course because I want to my on to a new career. I picked web
                development because it’s something that will encourage constant learning due to how fast technology
                changes. Programing also requires problem solving and thinking outside the box. I really like that
                aspect of programing. Moreover, I also enjoy working as a team to complete a project.
                <br><br>
                Some interesting facts about me is that I can speak three languages: Cantonese, Mandarin and English. I
                enjoy playing many different types of sports. I played soccer, baseball, football, basketball, track and
                volleyball during high school and middle school. I also enjoy playing video games. I only play computer
                games and my favorite games are: League of Legends, Overwatch, Dead by Daylight, and Maple Story. I also
                stream on Twitch on the side for fun.
